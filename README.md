# Animations in Angular 2 based off [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css).

The goal of this project is to recreate all of the animation events from animate.css using the animation tooling provided in Angular 2.

Each component will load 80 boxes that animate based on the chosen animation. Once the component has loaded you can also click on individual boxes and watch them animate off the screen.

## Setup

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `ng serve`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.25.5.

## Build for github.io

ng build --target production --output-hashing=none
